[@sentry/nextjs] Automatically enabling browser source map generation for turbopack build.
[@sentry/nextjs] Source maps will be automatically deleted after being uploaded to Sentry. If you want to keep the source maps, set the `sourcemaps.deleteSourcemapsAfterUpload` option to false in `withSentryConfig()`. If you do not want to generate and upload sourcemaps at all, set the `sourcemaps.disable` option to true.
